New Zealand Kiwis Form

New Zealand went down to the Kangaroos last weekend 22-10 in their first hitout of the Pacific Championships. With 58% of the Territory and 53% of possession the Kiwis looked dangerous throughout the game especially down Shaun Johnson’s right side. 

The left side defence though was found out in a number of tries that Australia scored with the Aussies having 5 linebreaks to 2 in the game. 

Thirty-seven missed tackles by the Kiwis contributed to the momentum that their opponents were able to create at times during the game which hampered their own chances with the ball.

New Zealand had 38 tackles inside the 20m zone of the Australian team and are almost guaranteed to have noted what can be improved to convert those chances into points in the next game.

Only the one change for the Kiwis with Leo Thompson joining the bench after serving a suspension from NRL finals. Jordan Riki reverts to the reserves.
